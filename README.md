## About
Vall ([as in the second Joolian moon](https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Vall)) VM is a simplistic bytecode running ontop of Lua for use in Stormworks, nullifying the 4096 (as of now) character limit imposed on scripts by allowing the program to be split
and stored across multiple scripts, and loaded and excuted on one seamlessly.
